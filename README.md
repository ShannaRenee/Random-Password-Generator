## Description
My motivation for making this random password generator was to craft a straightforward and foolproof application so that users can receive a password that includes their selected parameters. Longer passwords that contain a wide variety of different characters and have no discernable patterns are more secure than shorter, simpler ones. This password generator provides the user with a fast and efficient way to generate passwords so that their personal accounts and information are better protected. Through the process of working on this project, I gained a better understanding of how the Math.random method works, and I also gained some experience in manipulating information stored in arrays.

## Attributing source code
I used the random string generator found on this webpage: https://www.programiz.com/javascript/examples/generate-random-strings in my javascript file on lines 78-83. I changed the variable names to match my own variables.
